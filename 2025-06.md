# 2025-06 Edition

It has been almost 3 years since my last family letter. Things have drastically changed since June 2025 for my family and me. If you aren't in the mood for reading some rather depressing things, skip the section labeled 'depressing'

I'm trying a new method of sending out these emails using a newsletter service. If you don't want to receive these emails you can unsubscribe at this link.

## Depressing

As you may or may not know my family experienced multiple losses in the past couple of years. In October or thereabouts my father went into the hospital for an amputation of an infected leg. While there he became delirious, and I had to take over my parents' finances. He recovered mostly and was able to return home, but a few months later, around the time of my birthday, he suffered a stroke and his ability to speak was taken from him. It was devastating as he was always a gregarious individual who loved telling jokes and chatting people up. We ended up finding an in-home assistant to help take care of my parents, but to keep costs down they were only there during the day. During the morning and evening hours my brothers and I stepped in. Luckily my work was exceptionally flexible, and I was able to work from their house to be able to assist. At night we had provided my parents a button that would trigger notifications on our phones that they required assistance. I personally racked up a ton of mileage traveling back and forth to assist. It was one of the hardest things I had gone through to... up to that point.

During all of this my mother started exhibiting signs of memory deterioration. She would forget where she was when we drove around on errands. One time she started frying an egg and never came back to it. Luckily, someone was there at the time to prevent a house fire situation. It progressively got worse with her thinking she was younger and needing to go home. She would walk outside and wait inside the car to go to her home. Eventually she started wandering away down the street. It became more and more of a burden on the in home assistants. We eventually had to look into assisted living facilities. This terrified me because my parents had always said that they didn't want to live in a facility if possible. Growing up, we lived down the street from a 'retirement home' that we sometimes went to for church activities. It was frightening and smelly. Luckily we managed to find a decent and economical choice in [Eternal Spring of Gilbert](https://eternalspringaz.com/). Initially they moved into the assisted living side of the house where they could live on their own with some assistance. They moved in in April and ended up having to be moved to the memory care side of the facility within a few weeks. That really hurt but made a lot of sense. Luckily they were able to continue living together.

During this time my brothers and I took over every facet of their lives, other than daily care. I became the paperwork, finance, and appointment czar. That entailed getting Power of Attorney, documenting medications, scheduling appointments, traveling to and from appointments, and managing funds and payments. It was exhausting. Trying to gain access to accounts, both financial and electronic, was an eye opening experience. To everyone who have people who depend on them I say, MAKE A PLAN for your incapacitation or death. The experience caused me to write an "in case of death" letter so that in the event I was permanently unavailable, Sarah or someone else would know how to access funds, accounts and resources while attempting to sort through what will surely be a traumatic experience (because I am an irreplaceable delight ðŸ˜‰). My brother Mark, who was going through his own trials at the time moved into their house and started to prep it for sale. I wouldn't trade his experience for mine in a million years. The flooring all had to be ripped up, termite damage had to be repaired, the house had to be purged of bed bugs, the rooms all had to be painted, and walls patched, the possessions and belongings had to be sorted through and then sold, stored or donated. This was a monumental task, and I am thankful to this day that he was able to handle this. My brother Jacob was the caretaker and 'UberEATS' guru. He always made sure that Mom and Dad were well stocked with supplies, food and treats. Thank you, Jacob. Each of us and our spouses, during this time, had a number of rather awkward experiences and surprises. We ended up comparing notes and vying for the topmost awkward experience on the 'anti-bucket list'. I think we all came out losers though.

My father struggled in his new environment and was in and out of the hospital multiple times. Eventually he suffered from a minor cut on his foot that due to neglect became infected and eventually caused him to pass away. This was the hardest thing I had ever experienced and caused my brothers and I to weep like babies. My father was not peaceful or comfortable in his final days and for that I will be eternally saddened. His funeral however was very nice and a whole community of people came to pay their respects and to support his family. Even writing this I am tearing up. Thank you everyone. I heard many great stories, and I got to tell one of my favorite stories that my dad would tell about Earnhardt car dealership. If you havenâ€™t heard it, you should ask.
My mom was still mostly present but had some moments where confusion was setting in. At one point we made her ['business cards'](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF0Xzs0jS4/_OhlK-JLB7aAIDfZhxEvog/view?utm_content=DAF0Xzs0jS4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor) in case people wanted to visit or call her. At one point she asked to have a wish list of potential gifts placed on the back in case people wanted to give. We shut that down and she later had no recollection and thought we were pulling her leg. [We love and miss you dad.](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF0b08oct0/Ha4E7uLvEC6O9jp4z562fw/edit?utm_content=DAF0b08oct0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)

</div>

Mom (Teena) has been in the memory care facility since that time and has slowly declined. At first, she was very needy which is understandable. She would call me or especially Jacob all of the time to have us bring her ice, or treats, or fix the tv, etc. While we did it dutifully as sons it was frustrating because she was becoming less and less coherent and would call at all hours of the night. That has since mostly ceased, and she is much more mellow these days. If you try to visit her, I suggest doing so in the morning as she seems calmer then.

## Now time for everything to be all about me!

It has been a long few years and so I'm not quite sure of everything that has transpired since I last communicated.

I am now 45 and definitely feeling my age. I had my first colonoscopy recently which was certainly an experience. Sarah was killing it with the jokes while driving me there and waiting with me before the procedure. I'll spare you most, except for the one about my doctor. His name is Dr. Vulcano. Sarah asked a nurse if he got into this business because of his love of things that expel toxic gasses. Perhaps you needed to be there, but I was laughing my head off.

<div>

</div>

The prep wasn't as bad as everyone seems to indicate but it [certainly cleared my head](https://www.quotes.net/mquote/51889). Everything went 'smoothly' and aside from some benign stuff I was given a clean bill of health. I did however wake up mid-procedure. I was very confused and when I asked someone a question the anesthesiologist immediately gave me some more night-night juice.

I'm still working in a job where I get to work remotely from home. I love it! My commute is excellent, and it has been so helpful to have more time to help with my family. I recently saw a job posting at the Boeing Mesa facility that I would have been excellent for and might have meant a bit of a promotion, but it was an onsite position back on a 9x80 schedule. I debated for a bit but ultimately the promotion wouldn't have made sense for my family given the loss of remote flexibility.

The job itself has changed and moved more to a software developer role rather than strictly a data engineering roll. I love it because I'm learning so many new different things. I have learned so much and in this particular role I am able to apply some of what I have learned managing my own servers and services at home. The only frustration I have is that we use some very old technologies and most efforts at upgrading and updating are met with negative positions without any consideration.

Speaking of servers/services I have been having a lot of fun with this. Actually, if I am speaking truthfully I have a love/hate relationship with it.

When I am exploring new things or enjoying the fruits of my labor, I absolutely love it. When things are broken it frustrates the hell out of me. Sometimes I think about scaling back significantly.

Some of favorite new services are:

- [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) - Allows me to listen to my favorite audiobooks and podcasts anywhere instead of just on my phone.
- [OpenWebUI](https://docs.openwebui.com/) - Lets me have my own personal ChatGPT interface and history with a bunch of different large language models. Some models are better at some things than others. It also lets me do a bunch of customizations like when I created an interface for Tyson to be helped with homework rather than told the answers. It was fascinating watching it help find the answers without saying too much.
- [Paperless-ngx](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/) - Manages all of my documents. I'm a nerd and a bit obsessive about scanning and saving most documents. I always feel like I will be missing something when I need it. This has actually saved me a few times especially while navigating services for folks in my life.
- [StirlingPDF](https://stirlingpdf.io/) - Allows me to edit my PDFs. Works great in conjunction with Paperless-ngx
- [n8n](https://n8n.io/) - Allows me to establish workflows that automatically process things for me. For instance, whenever an email comes into my Gmail it feeds it to an AI model which categorizes it based on some parameters I established. Then it will drop the emails into a variety of buckets that I can quickly review at my leisure.
- [Vault/BitWarden](https://www.vaultwarden.net/) - Stores all of my passwords, passkeys and OTP authenticator keys.
- [Romm](https://romm.app/) - Allows me to play old video games through my web browser. Being able to play Dr Mario from anywhere is awesome.
- [Immich](https://immich.app/) - A Google Photos clone. I hate having to spend a ton of money on Google just to have limited space for photos. So instead, I spend a bunch of money powering a home server to have (nearly) unlimited space for photos. I don't know if this is a fair trade.

About a year ago for Father's Day, along with some of my own saved up cash, Sarah bought me a new 3D printer. It has been an absolute blast to play with. There are tons of websites where you can download print-ready 3D models; [makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en), [Printables](https://www.printables.com/), [Thangs](https://thangs.com/?sort=trending) and plenty of other ones. Even though there are a lot of cute things, I tend to stick to the ['white 'n' nerdy](https://images.footeprint.org/i/94ea2370-fb06-4a3f-94a4-fb225956c1c4.webp) stuff like organizers. There are two systems I use a lot: [Gridfinity](https://gridfinity.xyz/) and [Multiboard](https://www.multiboard.io/). Using both, I have organized extensively around the house; laundry room, kitchen drawers, junk drawers, filing cabinets, desk walls, cable routing under my desk. It is totally nerdy, and I love it.

We do have a bit of fun too. I made this posable action figure and some "Universal Gift Cards" for a nephew and niece's birthday.

</div>

Alex had me obtain a 3D printed No-Face mask from Spirited Away and he used it for Halloween. He also purchased the 3D model and the materials to print and paint a character figurine. I don't have a picture of the painted final product, but it looks nice.

</div>

 As you know I am an engineer, and I have some 3D modeling experience. I have started creating and uploading my own models for people to see and use on [Makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/@msfoote).

 In addition to 3D printing my other new hobby is something called Amazon Vine. I had heard about this program by reading Amazon comments that said something along the lines of "This review was written by someone who received the product free of charge". Since that time, I had been making a concerted effort to write reviews in the hopes of getting into the program. In June of last year, I was invited in and it has been a wild ride ever since.

To clarify, you do not exactly receive items free of charge. Basically, what happens is sellers will sign up with Amazon to have their product reviewed. Amazon places it in a list to be reviewed and the people in the program can grab available items. Everything has an estimated taxable value (ETV) which *usually* aligns with the price. Then when you do your taxes you have to claim your total ETV for the year as income. Depending on your tax bracket that could be a tiny amount or a large amount. So, when it comes to ordering things we try to only order stuff that we would buy if it cost 30% of what it actually costs. We handle the cost by increasing the withholding on our taxes a bit so at the end of year we aren't surprised by a big bill.

Most consumable type products have a $0 ETV. If you have been the beneficiary of free candy, deoderants, etc, now you know why.

In return for these *free* items, I have to process, use and review each of them. I actually find it somewhat relaxing to write the reviews and my family and I have discovered some delicious and awesome products that we would not have tried otherwise. [Shameless Snacks](https://eatshameless.com/) are absolutely the best gummy snacks hands down. We also snagged a Nugget Ice Maker. We used to go to Sonic periodically and now we just go to the water store **a lot**.

One challenge of this has been managing the packaging. It is so much cardboard. I've gotten really good at breaking down boxes and thankfully we use some of them to sell other stuff that I try to flip. That is the other caveat about Vine purchases. You have to retain items for at least 6 months prior to disposal. We also feel for the USPS and Amazon drivers who have to deliver all of this stuff. We try to keep a nice selection of the stuff we get, along with some waters for them.

## Tanner

When my dad was going through everything at the hospital, we realized that Tanner needed extra support as my dad was the most solid person in his life. Sarah and I talked about it and felt like the only viable option was to have him come live with us. We had a spare room where he was able to nest. It was a very challenging experience for all involved. My parents (and myself) were/are enablers who try to be very easy going. Everyone had grown quite comfortable in their habits and arrangements and all of that came crashing down.

We knew this had to be a temporary thing as Tanner was essentially an adult and needed to progress in his life. Our first priority was getting Tanner to finish up his education. We worked very hard with him to get him prepped and ready for his GED. He took the test and if I recall correctly passed with considerable margin.

Next step was a job. Tanner had previously worked at a Jersey Mike's that was, as Sarah would say, in lower Afghanistan. We had an Albertsons near us, and he got a job there. We expected him to get a cashier or cart position, but he ended up getting their customer service desk which I think may have been an excellent option for him. Unfortunately, at the customer service desk you sometimes deal with cranky people. So instead, he found himself a job working security. That suited him a lot better and at the time of this writing is working night security at an ASU building in Tempe

During all of this we knew that eventually he would need to transport himself around which meant driving. Tyson was turning 16 as well so we trained them up together. We drove around parking lots, school yards, quiet neighborhoods, etc. It was all very traumatizing for me ðŸ˜œ. In actuality they both rapidly increased in skill and were able to pass their driving exams and become licensed drivers. They used our van which is an automatic to learn and once done there I wanted them both to become proficient in driving a manual transmission. That was a lot more difficult and eventually gave up and found an old beater automatic that we use now.

The final step for Tanner was getting him out into the scary world. He managed to find a place right near the light rail in Tempe not too far from his ASU job, which worked out great. He has a roommate who by all accounts is very quiet and stays out of his business. We hear the funny kind of stories that we have all gone through while transitioning into our own lives. I suppose they are only funny to us and for him he will need some time.

## The Family

We stay busy with lots of stuff. Since our last letter we discovered cruising. Not cruising for chicks but leaving on a boat. We got a smoking deal on a very short cruise out of LA to Catalina Island and Ensenada. It was very cool being on the boat. I absolutely loved sitting on the side of the ship, feeling the wind and watching the ocean. The food was just ok it was a great experience. In Ensenada we got to eat our favorite fish tacos, get a picture with a cool sign, see a natural blowhole, and play with a tiger cub. We took one additional cruise to Cabo which was nice, but we realized it is freaking hot down there.

</div>

## Sarah

Sarah has been super active as of late. Her, Alex and I had all started taking variations of that wieght loss drug ozempic, but she started really working and striving to not just eat less and lose weight but to actually become healthier. She is consuming more protein, going to a gym and has introduced us to some alternative foods like quinoa (it actually tastes good). She is looking sexy as hell, and I'm worried I might start getting jealous with all of the folks checking her out. I still don't know how I got so lucky to have her as my partner.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;">
    <img src="https://images.footeprint.org/i/b47e9cd4-a9f0-4498-9156-de3c23108f47.webp?quality=50" alt="Boxes Galore" style="max-height: 200px; margin-right: 10px;">

</div>

She has also branched out in her hobbies becoming plant girl. She sprouts them, grows them, nurtures them, feeds them. It is like she has 20-30 green children. While we were dating, she had to do some science experiments with different plants. It reminds me of that except now she is doing it for fun.

Her parents are serving a mission in the Northwest corner of Georgia and for her birthday I arranged for her to travel to visit with them. They had a grand old time as shown by the picture below. Sarah was amazed at how lush and beautiful everything was. Maybe I can tempt her to have us move to the South someday, Washington vegetation without quite so much rain.

</div>

## Alex

Alex is doing ok. We discovered during a procedure that involved anaesthesia that he has something like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). His oxygen levels dropped like a rock, and he had to be taken to the hospital as a precaution. It was a surreal experience in that we were in this hospital with doctors and nurses, and we never could get a straight answer as to what happened. He had to stay for like a week. While I don't think he enjoyed the experience he didn't seem terribly distraught over it.

I don't recall if he was working when I last wrote a letter, but he has been working with a company called COPA Health for a long time now. They do group supported employment. I had experience working with them when I worked in the Boeing factory as they do some work there. Alex works at Boeing and the Mesa Public Library. I think it has been good for him and he has a small income stream all his own.

He has added to his hobbies. He is still drawing historical fictional characters, but he has also taken to collecting and displaying action figures and figurines. He has a great collection and has done a great job finding and purchasing them all on his own.

## Tyson

Tyson has hit an impressive milestone in graduating from High School. The graduation was an interesting affair, and I must say I really missed the COVID style graduations. It was pretty awkward. The principle is new and definitely not an experienced orator. At one point, after a few speeches, he said something to the effect of, "and now for the good speeches". It was very long and after everyone walked, they had another couple of speeches. We got a lot of really good graduation photos.
